# Locking Down Subscriptions

---------------------------------

Our application doesn't really require any locking down for our purposes, but we can lock them down when the need arises, so we'll cover that here: `src/resolvers/Subscription.js`:

```js
const Subscription = {
  comment: {
    subscribe(parent, { postId }, { prisma }, info) {
      return prisma.subscription.comment({
        where: {
          node: {
            post: {
              id: postId // looks for postId off of the post object
            }
          }
        }
      }, info)
    }
  },
  post: {
    subscribe(parent, { published }, { prisma }, info) {
      return prisma.subscription.post({
        where: {
          node: {
            published // all published posts
          }
        }
      }, info)
    }
  },
}
```



We'll create a new subscription that requires authentication, if we're authenticating we'll need to import the `getUserId()` :

```js
import getUserId from '../utils/getUserId';
```

```js
    subscribe(parent, args, {prisma, request}, info) {
      const userId = getUserId(request) {
        
      }
    }
```



Before we get too far, we'll need to address an issue that we've created that works just fine for queries and mutations, as is, but presents an issue for handling subscriptions: `src/utils/getUserId.js`

```js
const header = request.request.headers.authorization
// grab header from request
```

To handle requests for subscriptions we'll need to modify how we get the header: 

```js
const header = request.connection.context.Authorization
```

> **NOTE**: that `Authorization` is capitalized, when accessing it from context.

Now we don't need both of these lines always running, what we want is to use the `request.request.headers` for queries and mutations, this will ensure our entire application still works as is, then can serve up `Authorization` from `request.connection.context` if `request.request` doesn't exist â€” this tells us that we're dealing with a subscription, and that is when we'll set header from `request.connection.context`:

```js
const header = request.request ? request.request.headers.authorization : request.connection.context.Authorization
```

> if we encounter a query or mutation then our conditional check for `request.request` will return true and grab the `authorization` from `header` otherwise, if `request.request` resolves to false, then we know we're dealing with a subscription and can triggle the else clause: `request.connection.context.Authorization`

This completes the logic we need to make subscriptions work and keep queries and mutations workin as they have been. Next we can complete our `myPost` subscription in `src/resolvers/Subscription.js`:

```js
  myPost: {
    subscribe(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
      const userId = getUserId(request) {

      }
    }
  },
```

Challenge: Complete the myPosts subscription

---------------------------------

> 1. Defining the subscription in `src/schema.graphql`
>
>    ```js
>    type Subscription {
>        comment(postId: ID!): CommentSubscriptionPayload!
>        post: PostSubscriptionPayload!
>        myPost: PostSubscriptionPayload!
>    }
>    ```
>
>    
>
> 2. Use the correct prisma method to subscribe to posts.  `src/resolvers/Subscription.js`
>
>    - Limit to posts by a particular author using "where"
>
>    ```js
>      myPost: {
>        subscribe(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
>          const userId = getUserId(request)
>          return prisma.subscription.post({
>            where: {
>              node: { // allows access to item being filtered, in our case: posts
>                author: {
>                  id: userId
>                }
>              }
>            }
>          }, info) // make sure info is available
>        }
>      },
>    ```
>
> 3. Test Work:
>
> ```js
> subscription myPost {
>   myPost {
>     mutation
>     node{
>       id
>       title
>       body
>       published
>       author {
>         id
>         name
>         email
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> 
> ```
>
> > ```json

> The subscription now watches for changes to any post own by the current user., user must be logged in for the subscription to work, otherwise will throw an authentication error.
