# Logging In Existing Users

---------------------------------

Currently we're able to successfully generate a token from the server whenever a user registers, to do this we used `jwt.sign()` to sign the token && `jwt.verify()` to authenticate it. Now we need to be able to send the authenticated token back and store it on the client-side. 

 This will allow us to pass this token along with the user on the front-end whenever the user makes requests in the future. The token also contains a property `iat` - that is a timestamp.

To handle this behavoir we'll need a new mutation `Login` to handle the login functionality. 

> When a user logs in they will provide their plain text password and email, and we need to compare those the the hashed password and email we have saved in the database for that user. Let's look at how this will work for us
>
> > In our mutation we'll use the user's email to fetch the matching user, this will give us access to the user's hashed password from the database and we can compare the hashed password to the password submitted by the user.
>
> ```js
> const dummy = async () => {
>   const email = "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com"
>   const password = "bunty007"
>   
>   const hashedPassword = "$2a$10$Xwvj4ibCMeGtY0o3oGMqjuwVK45OvqQMOGSmu6dRaGLjIF/9LNce."
>   
>  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);
>   // compares the user provided password to the stored hashed password. returns boolean
>  
>   console.log(isMatch) // => true
> }
> 
> dummy()
> ```
>
> > In order to compare the user provided password to the hashed password, we'll use the `.compare()` from `bcrypt`, this operation will return a boolean value, indicating whether the two values match or not



Challenge: Create a login Mutation

---------------------------------

Part 1: Create the mutation

> 1. Define the mutation in `schema.graphql`
>
>    - should accept `email`/`pw` as arguments
>
>    ```js
>    input LoginUserInput {
>        email: String!
>        password: String!
>    }
>    ```
>
>    - should return `AuthPayload` - same as `createUser` 
>
>    ```js
>    login(data: LoginUserInput): AuthPayload!
>    ```
>
> 2. Define the mutation resolver method with 4 arguments in `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:
>
>    ```js
>      async login(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {
>        
>      },
>    ```



Part 2:  Verify Email and Password:

> 1. Query for the user by email. return all scalar fields on user value
>
>    - if no user, throw error
>
>    ```js
>    const user = await prisma.query.users({
>      where: {
>        email: data.email
>      }
>    }); // only need the scalar fields back, so no need to provide info as 2nd arg
>    if (!user) throw new Error('sorry unable to login: 2');
>    ```
>
> 2. Verify hashed user password with the pain text password argument
>
>    - if no match throw error
>
>    ```js
>    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(user.password, data.password);
>    if (!isMatch) throw new Error('sorry unable to login: 2');
>    ```
>
> **NOTE**: when it comes to providing error messages for login purposes, its best to be as generic as possible you do not want provide any information that helps determine the nature of the error to a hacker or somone maliciously trying to gain access to a user's account. 



Part 3: Send back the user with a new token:

> 1. Return an object that matched up with the fields expected for AuthPayload
>
>    - Generate a new JWT using the same secret as used for `createUser`
>
>    ```js
>    return {
>      user,
>      token: jwt.sign({ userid: user.id }, 'thisisasecret')
>    }
>    ```
>
> 2. Login with an existing user and get back user details and auth token
>
>    ```js
>    mutation login{
>      login(data: {
>        email: "g@g.com",
>        password: "abc12345"
>      }) {
>        user {
>          name
>          email
>        }
>        token
>      }
>    }
>    ```
>
>    > ```json
>    > {
>    >   "data": {
>    >     "login": {
>    >       "user": {
>    >         "name": "g",
>    >         "email": "g@g.com"
>    >       },
>    >       "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOiJjanhuaXkxOWEwMDFkMDc2MTViejR1OHpqIiwiaWF0IjoxNTYyMTc2NDI5fQ.8SPii5pOixqI4LAf-Pzh-889O7s4n1Nvs-TCiA_X01M"
>    >     }
>    >   }
>    > }
>    > ```
