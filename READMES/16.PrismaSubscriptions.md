# GraphQL Subscriptions with Prisma

---------------------------------

Using subscriptions with prisma has built-in support, unlike the manual method using `pubsub`. We can handle our subscription logic from `src/resolvers/subscription.js`:

```js
const Subscription = {
  comment: {
    subscribe(parent, { postId }, { db, pubsub }, info) {
      // 1. check if post exists & is published
      const post = db.posts.find((post) => post.id === postId && post.published)
      if (!post) throw new Error('no post found');

      // 2. return asyncIterator subscribed to a channelName:
      return pubsub.asyncIterator(`comment ${postId}`)
    }
  },
  post: {
    subscribe(parent, args, { pubsub }, info) {
      return pubsub.asyncIterator('post');
    }
  }
}

export { Subscription as default };
```

We can greatly simplify the logic let's start with the `comments` subscription, but before we do, we'll need to make a change to our `CommentSubscriptionPlayload` in `schema.graphql`:

```js
type CommentSubscriptionPayload {
    mutation: MutationType!
    // data: Comment!
    node: Comment
}
```

> **NOTE**:  that `node` is `nullable` and is not required, because the response will not have any data to send back.
>
> Since we have two databases, our typeDefs have fallen out of sync, ensuring that both payloads expect the same properties, so here we had to change the property `data` to `node` to match with our prisma database:

> We can clearly see from the screenshot above that our comment subscription expects two fields:

> -  `node` - is the prisma equivalent for `data`, so this is the change we had to make so that both were synonymous, and we've also made it `nullable` so that we can return null, since there is no data to return.



So now that we know why we had to make the changes, we can go ahead and handle the logic for the `comment` subscription: `src/resolvers/subscription.js`

```js
  comment: {
    subscribe(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {
      return prisma.subscription.comment(null, info)
    }
  },
```



Now we can use this in our playground:

```js
subscription comment{
	comment(postId: "10") {
		mutation
    node{
      id
      text
      author {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: we've swapped `data` out for `node` here as well, so that it sends the data across as node to the prisma database.

Now we can go ahead and provide the necc. operational arguments to our subscription call:

```js
  comment: {
    subscribe(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {
      return prisma.subscription.comment({
        where: {
          node: {
            post: {
              id: postId // looks for postId off of the post object
            }
          }
        }
      }, info)
    }
  },
```





Next we can do the same for the `post` subscription:

Change `data` to `node` and make sure its `nullable`: `schema.graphql`

```js
type PostSubscriptionPayload {
    mutation: MutationType!
    node: Post
}
```



Now update the `post` `subscribe()` to use the correct prisma method:

```js
  post: {
    subscribe(parent, { postId }, { prisma }, info) {
      return prisma.subscription.post({
        where: {
          node: {
            post: {
              id: postId
            }
          }
        }
      }, info)
    }
  }
```

> this makes sure we're matching the postId wtih the item for the subscription
