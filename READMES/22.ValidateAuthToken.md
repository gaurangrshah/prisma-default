# Validtating Auth Tokens

---------------------------------

Up to this point we're able to successfully log in users, and successfully send back a signed auth token. We now have to figure out how to send the token to our node.js server in order to authenticate the user. 

> We'll be using the `auth token` we generated when creating our user, and pass that in along with our mutation as a `http header` which allow us to pass values from the client to the server and vice versa. 

```js
{
  "data": {
    "login": {
      "user": {
        "name": "g",
        "email": "g@g.com"
      },
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOiJjanhuaXkxOWEwMDFkMDc2MTViejR1OHpqIiwiaWF0IjoxNTYyMTc2NDI5fQ.8SPii5pOixqI4LAf-Pzh-889O7s4n1Nvs-TCiA_X01M"
    }
  }
}
```

>  These headers can be sent to and from any client, whether its a web browser or an iOS application.

```js
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOiJjanhuaXkxOWEwMDFkMDc2MTViejR1OHpqIiwiaWF0IjoxNTYyMTc2NDI5fQ.8SPii5pOixqI4LAf-Pzh-889O7s4n1Nvs-TCiA_X01M"
}
```

Now that we have the headers setup to be sent along with the request, we can look at how to access jwt from our node.js server - in order to setup this up to work, we need to make a change to our context for our server: `src/index.js`: this is the current context:

```js
  context: {
    db, // setting database to context.
    pubsub,  // making pubsub instance accessible to resolvers
    prisma, // makes prisma available to application context.
  }
```

> And we'll want to modify context from being a simple object to a function that returns the context instead:
>
> ```js
>   context() {
>     return {
>       db, // setting database to context.
>       pubsub,  // making pubsub instance accessible to resolvers
>       prisma, // makes prisma available to application context.
>     }
>   } 
> ```
>
> Although this doesn't change much about how the context is setup, this change does allow us to access our headers off of our context now, let's take a look at why this is possible, we'll take a look at the `graphql-yoga` docs:  https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga

>
> **NOTE**: as per the docs, we can pass in the context as either an object or a function, and in the description we can see that it tells us how the context is used to pass thru custom data into our resolvers, furthermore states, that that function would have the following signature:
>
> ```js
> (req: ContextParameters) => any
> ```
>
> > This tells us that we can access any custom data we include in the context via the `req` argument
>
> In our case we can utilize the request object and pass it along with our context as such:
>
> ```js
>   context(request) {
>     console.log(request)
>     return {
>       db, // setting database to context.
>       pubsub,  // making pubsub instance accessible to resolvers
>       prisma, // makes prisma available to application context.
>       request, // allows us to access our custom headers from resolvers
>     }
>   } 
> ```
>
> > We can log what lives on the request object, by running any mutation from our playground...
> >
> > > The actual request object contains a ton of information that gets passed along from and to our server, but on that object we can see our headers already available., so we can access this by:
> >
> > ```js
> > console.log(reqeust.request.headers)
> > ```
> >
> > We can test this by running any operaton once again, and our log now should only contain the headers we're interested in:
> >
> > ```js
> > { host: 'localhost:4001',
> >   connection: 'keep-alive',

Now that we have our auth token and headers properly setup, and communicating between node.js, the client and prisma, we can now look at how to handle the actually verification of the token, enabling us to ensure its authenticity when first signed. 



We'll be setting up a utility function that handles our authentication so that we dont have to worry about re-writing the authentication logic for each resolver. Create a new directory called `src/utils` create a new file: `getUserId.js`

`src/utils/getUserId.js`:

```js
const getUserId = () => {

}

export { getUserId as default };
```

Then we can be sure to import it in `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

```js
import getUserId from '../utils/getUserId';
```

Let's setup the logic of how we'll use `getUserId()`:

```js
createPost(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
  // destructure request from context

	const userId = getUserId(request)
  
  /* ... */
  
},
```



Now that we are passing along the request into `src/utils/getUserId.js`:

```js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

	const getUserId = (request) => {
  // grab header from request -> clear token -> verify token

  const header = request.request.headers.authorization
  // grab header from request

  if (!header) throw new Error('authentication required')
  // throw error if no header

  const token = header.replace('Bearer ', '');
  // removes the word 'Bearer'  from header and replaces it with: '' (empty string)

  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'thisisasecret')
  // verify the token using the secret we've used originally

  return decoded.userid; // returns the user.id from verified token
}

export { getUserId as default };

```



Now we can make the modifications we need in the `createPost` mutation, where instead of using the author id to connect the user to the post, we can now use the `userId` that gets returned from `getUserId()`:

```js
 async createPost(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
    // destructure request from context
    const userId = getUserId(request); // verifies auth token returns userId

    return await prisma.mutation.createPost({
      data: {
        title: args.data.title,
        body: args.data.body,
        published: args.data.published,
        author: {
          connect: {
            id: userId // uses verified userId from token to connect to author
          }
        }
      }
    }, info)
  },
```



We'll need to make a change to our schema, currently we're requiring an `ID` be provided for the author field,  and we just removed that dependency, so we'll make sure to reflect that here `schema.graphql`:

```js
input CreatePostInput {
    title: String!
    body: String!
    published: Boolean!
    #author: ID!
}
```

> we no longer need to require the author id, as we are no grabbing that from our verified token, when a post gets created.

---------------------------------

 ```js
mutation createPost{
  createPost(data: {title:"Testing Token", body: "Follow it", published: false,}) {
    id
    title
    body
    published
    author{
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
 ```

> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createPost": {
>       "id": "cjxnogaq2002g07618mdr21wg",
>       "title": "Testing Token",
>       "body": "Follow it",
>       "published": false,
>       "author": {
>         "id": "cjxniy19a001d07615bz4u8zj",
>         "name": "g"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Now we are able to successfully send our request to create a post using our auth token and passing it to the server for verification using `http headers` 



Now that we have our authentication setup for `createPost` only authenticated users who pass along valid tokens in the header, will have permission to create a post.
