# Integrating Prisma with Node.js

------

Our goal is to connect our postgres database to our Node.js application, effectively allowing Node.js to be able to read/write data to and from the database just as we can with our prisma graphql api. 

In order to achieve this prisma exposes what are called `"bindings"` which allow us to "bind" queries, mutations, subscriptions, etc to node based javascript functions, allowing our application to use these bindings to interact with and maintain the data in our database. 

> ### Prisma Bindings: https://github.com/prisma/prisma-binding

> **Example**
>
> Consider the following data model for your Prisma service:
>
> ```js
> type User {
> id: ID! @unique
> name: String
> }
> ```
>
> If you instantiate `Prisma` based on this service, you'll be able to send the following queries/mutations:
>
> ```js
> // Instantiate `Prisma` based on concrete service
> const prisma = new Prisma({
> typeDefs: 'schemas/database.graphql',
> endpoint: 'https://us1.prisma.sh/demo/my-service/dev',
> secret: 'my-super-secret-secret'
> })
> 
> // Retrieve `name` of a specific user
> prisma.query.user({ where: { id: 'abc' } }, '{ name }')
> 
> // Retrieve `id` and `name` of all users
> prisma.query.users(null, '{ id name }')
> 
> // Create new user called `Sarah` and retrieve the `id`
> prisma.mutation.createUser({ data: { name: 'Sarah' } }, '{ id }')
> 
> // Update name of a specific user and retrieve the `id`
> prisma.mutation.updateUser({ where: { id: 'abc' }, data: { name: 'Sarah' } }, '{ id }')
> 
> // Delete a specific user and retrieve the `id`
> prisma.mutation.deleteUser({ where: { id: 'abc' } }, '{ id }')
> ```
>
> Under the hood, each of these function calls is simply translated into an actual HTTP request against your Prisma service (using [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-request)).
>
> The API also allows to ask whether a specific node exists in your Prisma database:
>
> ```js
> // Ask whether a post exists with `id` equal to `abc` and whose
> // `author` is called `Sarah` (return boolean value)
> prisma.exists.Post({
> id: 'abc',
> author: {
>  name: 'Sarah'
> }
> })
> ```
>

## Install & Setup Prisma Bindings for Node.js

install into the `/prisma/` directory:

```shell
yarn add prisma-binding@2.1.1 
```

We'll need a new file `src/prisma.js`, where we can define our applications prisma bindings:

```js
import { Prisma } from 'prisma-binding';
```

> "Prisma" - is a constructor function used to create a connection to a prisma endpoint.
>
> - the function takes a single argument used to pass in "options"

```js
// call prisma constructor and store its return value:
const prisma = new Prisma({
  // generates a new instance of `Prisma` as `prisma`
  typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql', 
  // assigns the typeDefs from our fetched schema to create schema & bindings
  endpoint: 'http://192.168.99.100:4466' // endpoint for the prisma-gql api
})
```

> There are two options properties that we must provide to our prisma constructor:
>
> - `typeDefs` - the schema that our application uses from the endpoint that we are connecting to. 
>
>   > The prisma binding library uses the `typeDefs` passed along here in order to create the various methods we'll need for interacting with that data. In this way all the methods that get generated are always methods that are needed in order to work with the data we have based on our `typeDefs`.
>
> 
>
> > ❌ it is a common mistake to use the typeDefs from the `datamodel.prisma` file to pass in as our options to our `Prisma()` constructor. Instead we'll use a library(`graphql-cli`) that will allow us to reference our typeDefs from an external resource, that is connected directly to the prisma APIllll
>
> 
>
> - `endpoint` - the actual url where the prisma graphql api can be accessed by our application.



## Install & Configure GraphQL CLI for fetching schema

Once we have the options configured we'll need to install another library called `GraphQL-Cli` which we need inorder to actually pass in our typeDefs. — the library is used to perform common graphQL tasks, including fetching our schema like we do in graphQL playground, which is exactly what we'll be using it for.

```shell
yarn add graphql-cli@2.16.4
```

> ### GraphQL CLI: https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli

> *Commands available*:
>
> ```js
> Usage: graphql [command]
> 
> Commands:

> we'll be using `graphql get-schema` which allows us to download our schema from a given endpoint, we'll be defining this command as a script from `package.json`.



To configure `GraphQL-CLI` we'll need to create a new `.graphqlconfig` file - in the root of the project:

```js
{
  "projects": {
    "prisma": {
      "schemaPath": "src/generated/prisma.graphql",
      "extensions": {
        "endpoints": {
          "default": "http://192.168.99.100:4466"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> `schemaPath`: the path where the file we generate should be saved, it is best practice to save this file as `src/generated/prisma.graphql` , note that we've created a new directory: "generated".
>
> `extensions`: is an object that also gets passed in for us, for our purposes we want to use it to define our endpoints for our api . `http://192.168.99.100:4466`



Configure  `get-schema` command via `package.json`:

```js
"get-schema": "graphql get-schema -p prisma",
```



Now if we were to run:

```shell
npm run get-schema
```

> the command will connect to our database, and generate our schema from the endpoint we provided in our configuration above. This will automatically create the `/generated/` directory and the `prisma.graphql` file.
>
> ```shell
> > graphql-basics@1.0.0 get-schema /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-new
> > graphql get-schema -p prisma
> 
> project prisma - Schema file was updated: src/generated/prisma.graphql
> ```

This file now contains our autogenerated schema that we had access to from our graphql playground, giving us the ability to pull from that same generated schema from node.js.

This generated file is never manually edited, but will be updated each time we run the `get-schema` command and is saved as `src/generated/prisma.graphql`
