# Setup Heroku / Postgres / Prisma

---------------------------------

- Sign up for Heroku 
- Create an app / name it. 
- add an add-on to the app
- search for postgres and add it as an add-on - free tier.

Heroku will host our PostGres Database.

PGAdmin gives us a gui to connect to our Heroku Database and interact with the data.

We need to take the data that heroku generates above and enter it into PG admin to configure it:

Once we have our postgres db successfully hosted on heroku, and accessible via PGAdmin, we can turn our attention to configuring our docker installation:

Install Prisma:

```shell
npm i -g prisma@1.25.0
```

Initialize Prisma in a project: [from the project root directory]

```js
prisma init prisma
```

> `prisma init` takes an argument, which is the name of the project for prisma, which we've also named `prisma`

Follow the prompts in the terminal to configure prisma with our postgres db:

> ```shell
> ? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server? Use existing datab
> ase
> ? What kind of database do you want to deploy to? PostgreSQL
> ? Does your database contain existing data? No

> ? Enter database port 5432
> ? Enter database user eoqnudgxmfjstq
> ? Enter database password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
> ? Enter database name daq6m7ds138ivf
> ? Use SSL? Yes
> ? Enter name of existing schema schema.graphql

Prisma has automatically generated 3 core files we'll need in order to integrate our database with prisma:

1. `datamodel.prisma` - defines any typeDefs that we want prisma to be aware of — similar to schema.graphql

   ```js
   type User {
     id: ID! @id @unique
     name: String!
   }
   ```

   > prisma uses the datamodel to determine the structure of the tables

   

2. `prisma.yml` - a configuration file for our prisma server: 

   ```js
   endpoint: http://localhost:4466
   datamodel: datamodel.prisma
   ```

3. `docker-compose-yml` - this is our bootstrap file for the docker container that contains all our server and database configurations:

   ```js
   version: '3'
   services:
     prisma:
       image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.25
       restart: always
       ports:
       - "4466:4466"
       environment:
         PRISMA_CONFIG: |
           port: 4466
           # uncomment the next line and provide the env var PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=my-secret to activate cluster security
           # managementApiSecret: my-secret
           databases:
             default:
               connector: postgres
               host: ec2-54-243-208-234.compute-1.amazonaws.com
               port: '5432'
               database: daq6m7ds138ivf
               ssl: true /* must be true */
               user: eoqnudgxmfjstq
               password: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
               migrations: true
   
   ```





Deploy:

- Run Docker from `/prisma`

  ```shell
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Deploy Application

  ```js
  prisma deploy
  ```
