# Explore Prisma Production 

---------------------------------

Prisma cloud offers a few useful tools aside from the syncing of our database and application. When we navigate to our new service we just created we have access to a dashboard from where we can access several of those key features:

> - Prisma Admin - Offers a Gui environment for viewing and interacting with our data
> - Metrics - Stats about our database and server.
> - Deployment History - keeps a record of changes
> - Playground - A production graphQL playground environment - note that when we open the playground fro m this are, we automatically get the authorization headers included in our requests.

This now gives us a fresh production database, we can start to test it by adding some data:

```js
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}

```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "users": []
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > We get back an empty array because we have no data in this database, but <u>note</u> that we have access to all the queries and mutations from our production `@4466` environment



To test that we can use the `createUser` mutation to add a user:

```js
mutation createUser {
  createUser(
    data: {
    	name: "Greg"
    	email: "greg@email.com"
    	password: "acb12345"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createUser": {
>       "id": "cjyi2r27w000z0761cc7k48ck",
>       "name": "Greg"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> ```js
> query {
>   users {
>     id
>     name
>   }
> }
> 
> ```
>
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "data": {
> >     "users": [
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjyi2r27w000z0761cc7k48ck",
> >         "name": "Greg"
> >       }
> >     ]
> >   }
> > }
> > ```



We should be able to confirm that we can successfully access this data across the board:

> **NOTE**: password is currently plain text, because we input this user directly from the server's graphQL playground 



We can also verify the same info in prisma admin:
