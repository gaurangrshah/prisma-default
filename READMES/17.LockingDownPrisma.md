# Locking Down Prisma

---------------------------------

Currently we've setup node as a middleman, between our server and our client, this works well as we're able to create node functions that handle all of our database queries and mutations for us from the client side. But the draw back is that we can still navigate to `http://localhost:4466` and access our database, and perform any queries and/or mutations we need, essentially bypassing node.

This is why we'll be setting up a `prisma secret` which is a token/password that only we have access to. Anyone who wants to write, update, or remove data will then need to vertify the secret - which will then allow the action to be performed. Let's look at how we can setup the prisma secret for our client requests thru node:

`prisma/prisma.yml`

```js
endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
secret: thisismysupersecrettext # Can be changed later, and will become an env variable also
```

We'll need to redeploy prisma for these changes to take effect from `prisma/`:

```shell
Deploying service `default` to stage `default`
 to server `default` 4.1s
Service is already up to date.
Applying changes 6.8s
```

At this point we've effectively locked down our prisma database, and we can prove that by attempting to make a request from the graphql-playground:

```js
query posts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    body
  }
}
```

> a simple query for our posts:
>
> ```js
> {
>   "data": null,
>   "errors": [
>     {
>       "message": "Your token is invalid. It might have expired or you might be using a token from a different project.",
>       "locations": [],
>       "path": [
>         "posts"
>       ],
>       "code": 3015,
>       "requestId": "local:cjxmqm5j0009n0761qh4w1i7r"
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> gives us an error telling us our token is invalid.
>
> the same thing will happen if we run a query in the other playground @ :4466



To allow node.js to be the only thing to communicate with our server, we'll need to make one more change, essentially telling node.js how to communicate with the server using the secret key we've created:

`src/prisma.js`:

```yml
export const prisma = new Prisma({
  typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
  endpoint: 'http://192.168.99.100:4466',
  secret: 'thisismysupersecrettext',
});
```



Now if we query from our playground @ :4001, we can see that node js is able to query our database, using the secret we just defined, but we can no longer run, queries or mutations via the playground @ :4466, because we want to make sure that only node.js is allowed to directly communicate with the database.

> We can setup an `authorization-token` in the playground@:4466 to allow it to communicate with the server from our local instance:
>
> from the `prisma/` directory:
>
> ```shell
> prisma token
> ```
>
> > this will generate a token for us from prisma that allows our local instance to communicate with our server, allowing us to still run queries and mutations from the playground@:4466, by adding a token to our "HTTP Headers" pasted in from the console - immediately following the word "Bearer"

> > ```js
> > "Authorization": "Bearer <token_value>"
> > ```
>
> And now we can once again query from both playground instances, securely.
