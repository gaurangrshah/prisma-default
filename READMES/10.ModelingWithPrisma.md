# Modeling Project With Prisma

---------------------------------

To accomplish this we'll make a duplicate copy of our `/prisma` directory, we'll need everything in the directory execpt for the `docker.compose` file.  — we do not need a separate instance of our database instead all we need to do is make a change to the new duplicated `prisma.yml` file:

```js
endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466
```

> when we define a standard endpoint, prisma does two things for us, basically it sets both the "service" name and the "stage" name to "default". - this can be customized by adding onto it:
>
> ```js
> endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466/reviews/default
> ```
>
> Here `/reviews` is the name if our "service", while our "stage" is still set `/default`

This allows us to create separate projects within the confines of the same docker container.



Now that we have our duplicate project structure, with a endpoint specifically configured to it, move onto defining the types we need for this project `/prisma-review/datamodel.prisma`:

```js
type User {
  id: ID! @id @unique
}
```

> we have just one type defined: `User`



This will be our dummy starter, and we can work on customizing our new endpoint with data relevant to a new project. 

As always whenever we make changes to our schema we want to ensure those changes get reflected in our prisma mappings: navigate to the right folder in the terminal `prisma-review/` — then deploy the new schema:

```shell
prisma deploy
```

> ```shell
> ➜ prisma deploy
> Creating stage default for service reviews ✔
> Deploying service `reviews` to stage `default`
>  to server `default` 1.6s
> 
> Changes:
> 
>   User (Type)
>   + Created type `User`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
> 
> Applying changes 3.4s
> ```



<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; border: 1px solid grey; margin: 0 auto;">
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
			<pre><code>
        	Now if we take a look in `PGAdmin`:
      </pre></code>
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
	    <img src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g4l0mcah0mj30fb0glta2.jpg"/>
    </div>
</div>

> We can see that we now have a new endpoint for the reviews service, and that endpoint has 1 table with one type in it, which has one column called `id`

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; border: 1px solid grey; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
	  <pre><code>
	     GraphQL Schema in Playground:		
      </pre></code>
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
	    <img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g4l100rvrhj30qm0gidhk.jpg" />
    </div>
</div>

> We can verify that our schema now only includes the queries, mutations and subscriptions for the `type` of `User`



As we can see from this structure we have two completely different tables in our database that are independent of each other running in the same database. . because of this **NOTE**:  that the new endpoint for the playground has also been updated: http://192.168.99.100:4466/reviews/default

---------------------------------

Now let's take a look at the model and our objectives for this new endpoint:

![image-20190701171745676](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g4l1cxhnioj30ra0f9q87.jpg)

```js
type Book {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  title: String!
  author: String!
  isbn: String!
  reviews: [Review!]! @relation(name: "ReviewToBook", onDelete: CASCADE)
}

type User {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  username: String! @unique
  reviews: [Review!]! @relation(name: "ReviewToUser", onDelete: CASCADE)
}

type Review {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  text: String
  rating: Int!
  book: Book! @relation( name: "ReviewToBook", onDelete: SET_NULL)
  author: User! @relation(name: "ReviewToUser", onDelete: SET_NULL)
}
```



Now we can once again run

```js
prisma deploy
```

> ```js
> Deploying service `reviews` to stage `default`
>  to server `default` 2.3s
> 
> Changes:
> 
>   Book (Type)
>   + Created type `Book`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
>   + Created field `title` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `author` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `isbn` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `reviews` of type `[Review!]!`
> 
>   Review (Type)
>   + Created type `Review`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
>   + Created field `text` of type `String`
>   + Created field `rating` of type `Int!`
>   + Created field `book` of type `Book!`
>   + Created field `author` of type `User!`
> 
>   User (Type)
>   + Created field `username` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `reviews` of type `[Review!]!`
> 
>   ReviewToUser (Relation)
>   + Created an inline relation between `Review` and `User` in the column `author` of table `Review`
> 
>   ReviewToBook (Relation)
>   + Created an inline relation between `Book` and `Review` in the column `book` of table `Review`
> 
> Applying changes (5/17) ⣽
> ```
>
> we can see our updated schema:

Next up let's test and ensure everything is up and working by running a `createBook` mutation:

> ```js
> mutation {
>   createBook(
>     data: {
>       title: "Rest",
>       author: "Alex Pong",
>       isbn: "abc123"
>     }
>   ) {
>     id
>     title
>     author
>     isbn
>     reviews {
>       id
>       text
>       rating
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > we could grab reviews and the name of the person who published the review off of reviews, but we don't have any reviews or users setup.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createBook": {
>       "author": "Alex Pong",
>       "id": "cjxkws7bp003j0761ffl9o4b9",
>       "reviews": [],
>       "isbn": "abc123",
>       "title": "Rest"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```



next let's create a user using the `createUser` mutation:

```js
mutation {
  createUser(
    data:{
      username: "SleepyGuy"
    }
  ) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createUser": {
>       "id": "cjxkxagd7003o0761mac1gt1n",
>       "username": "SleepyGuy"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

```js
mutation {
  createUser(
    data:{
      username: "SleepyGal"
    }
  ) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createUser": {
>       "id": "cjxkxawv9003t07617q127341",
>       "username": "SleepyGal"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```



Next we can go ahead and create some reviews for our new users:

```js
mutation{
  createReview(
    data: {
      text: "great read"
      rating: 5
      book: {
        connect: {
          id: "cjxkws7bp003j0761ffl9o4b9"
        }
      },
      author: {
        connect: {
          id: "cjxkxawv9003t07617q127341"
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    text
    rating
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createReview": {
>       "id": "cjxkxfhg700400761wg1unbpr",
>       "text": "great read",
>       "rating": 5
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> We'll create another review using the id from the 1st user we created:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createReview": {
>       "id": "cjxkxgez500470761897i8hqc",
>       "text": "great read",
>       "rating": 5
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Now we have two reviews by two different users, on the same book:
>
> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "reviews": [
>       {
>         "id": "cjxkxfhg700400761wg1unbpr",
>         "text": "great read",
>         "rating": 5,
>         "author": {
>           "id": "cjxkxawv9003t07617q127341",
>           "username": "SleepyGal"
>         }
>       },
>       {
>         "id": "cjxkxgez500470761897i8hqc",
>         "text": "great read",
>         "rating": 5,
>         "author": {
>           "id": "cjxkxagd7003o0761mac1gt1n",
>           "username": "SleepyGuy"
>         }
>       }
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```



Next up let's test out our relationships by deleting a user and seeing if we successfully delete their review as well:

```js
mutation {
  deleteUser(
    where: {
      id: "cjxkxagd7003o0761mac1gt1n"
    }
  ) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "deleteUser": {
>       "id": "cjxkxagd7003o0761mac1gt1n",
>       "username": "SleepyGuy"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```



Now if we run our reviews query again:

```js
query reviews {
  reviews {
  	id
    text
    rating
    author {
      id
      username
    }
  }
}
```

> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "reviews": [
>       {
>         "id": "cjxkxfhg700400761wg1unbpr",
>         "text": "great read",
>         "rating": 5,
>         "author": {
>           "id": "cjxkxawv9003t07617q127341",
>           "username": "SleepyGal"
>         }
>       }
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```



Next let's make sure that if we delete a book we then remove any reviews associated with it:

```js
mutation deleteBook{
  deleteBook(
    where: {
      id: "cjxkws7bp003j0761ffl9o4b9"
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    author
    isbn
    reviews {
      id
      text
      author{
        id
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "deleteBook": {
>       "author": "Alex Pong",
>       "id": "cjxkws7bp003j0761ffl9o4b9",
>       "reviews": [],
>       "isbn": "abc123",
>       "title": "Rest"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> 

Now if we run our qeury for books:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "books": []
  }
}
```

> we have no books left, and no associated data
