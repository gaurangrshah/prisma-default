# Environment Variables in Production

---------------------------------

We've already secured our endpoints, by providing environment variables for them. We have one set of configurations in this case for production and one for our local dev environment. But we also have our secret, and we can take a similar approach to securing this information by creating an environment variable for it and passing that same variable across to heroku so it has access to it. The difference this time is only that we need to use that same value for the variable regardless of which environment, unlike the endpoint the secret will not differ between production and development.



`prisma.js`

```js
const prisma = new Prisma({
    typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
    endpoint: process.env.PRISMA_ENDPOINT,
  
    // secret: 'thisismysupersecrettext',
    secret: process.env.PRISMA_ENDPOINT,
  
  fragmentReplacements
})
```



`prisma.yml`

```js
endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
# secret: thisismysupersecrettext
secret: ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
```





Now our secret is no longer in our codebase we can now set the enviornment variables for both production and development:

`config/dev.env`

```js
PRISMA_SECRET=aRsmQgBE8M4SN2W5769s
```

`config/prod.env`

```js
PRISMA_SECRET=aRsmQgBE8M4SN2W5769s
```

>  **NOTE**: the two files contain different values for the secret variable.



Now that we have the key/value for the both environments, we'll need to tell prisma which secret it needs to use for production, we can do that from the command line:

```shell
graph-new on î‚  master [$!] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v12.6.0 took 3s 

âžœ heroku config:set PRISMA_SECRET=aRsmQgBE8M4SN2W5769s

Setting PRISMA_SECRET and restarting â¬¢ whispering-citadel-73999... â£¾ 
Setting PRISMA_SECRET and restarting â¬¢ whispering-citadel-73999... done, v11
PRISMA_SECRET: aRsmQgBE8M4SN2W5769s
```

> Then we can check the variables we just configured by outputting our configuration:
>
> ```shell
> graph-new on î‚  master [$âœ˜!?] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v12.6.0 took 2s 
> 
> âžœ heroku config                                       
> 
> === whispering-citadel-73999 Config Vars
> PRISMA_ENDPOINT: https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod
> PRISMA_SECRET:   aRsmQgBE8M4SN2W5769s
> ```
>
> Now we have our secret and our endpoint configured through environmental variables both for our local environement and our production environment. 



We can test our work locally first:

```shell
graph-new on î‚  master [$âœ˜!?] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v12.6.0 

âžœ cd prisma
```

```shell
graph-new/prisma on î‚  master [$âœ˜!?] 

âžœ prisma deploy -e ../config/prod.env
```

> we havent made any actual changes to this application, so we dont see any changes populated, but upon deploying we'll have updated the secert on heroku. 



Next we can make sure our secret is working locally `@:4000` by running a query in our local playground as long as we have access to the secret we should be able to complete our request: 

>  ensure that the docker instance is running, otherwise we won't get a response. 

```js
query users {
  users {
		name
  }
}
```

> ```js
> {
>   "data": {
>     "users": [
>       {
>         "name": "greg"
>       },
>       {
>         "name": "jeff"
>       },
>       {
>         "name": "joe"
>       },
>       {
>         "name": "sally"
>       },
>       {
>         "name": "sara"
>       }
>     ]
>   }
> }
> ```



In the output we'll notice an warning about `@babel-polyfill` being loaded twice, and it is correct we are loading it twice, once in our index.js and once in our start script when we load `babel-node` which also includes `@babel-polyfill` To rectify this warning, we can make a simple change to how we import `@babel-node` via `index.js`:

```js
import '@babel/polyfill/noConflict'
```

> avoids conflict that occurs and warning that gets ouput in regards to loading babel twice. 

```shell
git status
```

```shell
git add . && git commit -m "updates babel loading ++ prisma secret"
```

```shell
prisma deploy heroku master
```





```shell
heroku plugins:install heroku-repo

heroku repo:purge_cache -a <appname>

git commit --allow-empty -m "Purge cache"
git push heroku master
  heroku logs --tail
```

> ```shell
> heroku repo:purge_cache -a whispering-citadel-73999
