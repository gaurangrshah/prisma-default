# Updating Passwords

---------------------------------

Currently when we create an account a user must provide a password for their account. This works just fine, the issue is, that when a user is updating their account information via the `updateUser` mutation, they are still not able to update or change their originally provided password. We can make this change in schema via `src/schema.graphql`, 

> We're currently providing our `updateUser` mutation with an input selection set called `UpdateUserInput`:
>
> ```js
> updateUser(data: UpdateUserInput!): User!
> ```
>
> The UpdateUserInput selection set only has two fields on it that can be updated by the user:
>
> ```js
> input UpdateUserInput {
>     name: String
>     email: String
> }
> ```
>
> We'll just need to define a selection for the password field here as well:

```js
input UpdateUserInput {
    name: String
    email: String
    password: String
}
```

This allows the user to update the password field if they need to, using the `updateUser` mutation, although we are currently not hashing the password in our update user mutation, and this is a big issue, so, we'll need to handle the hashing of the password from `updateUser` if the password field ever does get updated.

To do this, we'll actually want extract out our password hashing to a utility function, so that we're not duplicating that code repeatedly - create new file: `src/utils/hashPassword.js`:

```js
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

const hashPassword = (password) => {
  
}

export { hashPassword as default }
```

> We'll need the bcrypt library since we're going to need it to hash our password, we're also going to need to take in a password, which the user provides as a 'string'. And lastly we'll need to export `hashPassword()` out so that we can use it in our mutations.

Now we can extract our the password hashing functionality from `src/resolvers/Mutation.js` `createUser`:

```js
async createUser(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {

  if (args.data.password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password must be 8 characters or longer')
  }

  const password = await bcrypt.hash(args.data.password, 10)


  /* ... */

},
```



and we can use it exactly as is for our `hashPassword()` utility in `src/utils/hashPassword.js`:

```js
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

const hashPassword = (password) => {
  if (password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password must be 8 characters or longer')
  }

  return bcrypt.hash(password, 10)
}

export { hashPassword as default }
```

> we'll needed to make sure we were no accounting for the password being passed in as an argument, and instead of assigning the hashed password to a variable, we're just returning it explictly.

Now we can use our utility function throughout our mutations whenever we need to hash a password, let's start by updating the `createUser` mutation: `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

First we'll need to import the utility function into the file:

```js
import hashPassword from '../utils/hashPassword';
```

Then we can use it to replace our original in-line hashing logic:

```js
async createUser(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {

  // if (args.data.password.length < 8) {
  //  throw new Error('Password must be 8 characters or longer')
  // }

  // const password = await bcrypt.hash(args.data.password, 10)

  const password = await hashPassword(args.data.password);

  const user = await prisma.mutation.createUser({  
    data: {
      ...args.data, 
      password,
    }
  });

  return {
    user,
    token: generateToken(user.id)
    // takes in an id returns an authorized Token
  }

},
```



This now completely replaces the logic we were using for `createUser` and also means we can now use this same utility for `updateUser`:

We'll first want include a check to see if the user is indeed updating their password:

```js
if (typeof args.data.password === 'string') {
  // check if password is being updated

}
```

only if a valid string is found as `password`:

```js
if (typeof args.data.password === 'string') {
  args.data.password = await hashPassword(args.data.password);
}
```
