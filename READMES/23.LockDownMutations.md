# Locking Down Mutations

---------------------------------

Now that we have one mutation integrated with our authentication scheme, it's much easier to implement that scheme across the rest of our mutations, queries, or subscriptions. We already have everything in place, so its just adding a few lines of code for each one.  We'll start by making some changes to the `updateUser` mutation, we'll have to add a simple bit of logic here to

 - ensure that user owns post that is being updated, users can only make updates to posts they own. 

 `schema.graphql`:

```js
#updateUser(id: ID!, data: UpdateUserInput!): User!
updateUser(data: UpdateUserInput!): User!
```

> since only an authorized user can make updates, we no longer need to explictily provide an `ID` to our mutation.

 `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

start by using the `request` object available from `context` to authenticate the user

```js
const userId = getUserId(request);
```

> When we call `getUserId()` we etiher throw an error if the user is not authenticated, or we return an ID for the authenticated user. if we get back an ID then we can go ahead and use tha id to update the post with. 
>
> ```js
> where: { userId }, // authenticated user's ID
> ```



Here's the full mutation:

```js
updatePost(parent, { id, data }, { prisma, request }, info) {
  // desctructures request from ctx.

  const userId = getUserId(request);
  // verify if the user is authenticated, return userId for authenticated users.

  return prisma.mutation.updatePost({ 
    where: { userId }, // authenticated user's ID
    ...data 
  }, info)
},
```

---------------------------------

```js
mutation updateUser{
  updateUser(data: {name: "gg1", email: "yg@email.com"}) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: mutation requires authorization headers:
>
> ```js
> {
>   "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOiJjanhuaXkxOWEwMDFkMDc2MTViejR1OHpqIiwiaWF0IjoxNTYyMTc2NDI5fQ.8SPii5pOixqI4LAf-Pzh-889O7s4n1Nvs-TCiA_X01M"

>     }
>   }
> }

`schema.graphql`:

```js
#deleteUser(id: ID!): User!
deleteUser: User!
```

> We no longer want to anyone to be able to delete a user by providing an ID, instead we want to use the authenticated user, and only allow them to delete themselves.  
>
> *Auth Token must be passed into http header*

`src/resolvers/Mutation.js`

```js

async deleteUser(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
  const userId = getUserId(request); // verifies auth token returns userId

  return prisma.mutation.deleteUser({ where: { id: userId } }, info); 
  // passes in userId from getUserId()
},
```

```js
mutation deleteUser{
  deleteUser {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: we are no longer passing in any arguments, as we do not need the user to provide the ID of the user to be removed, this means the only user they can request a removal for is themselves, and so as long as they are authenticated we can remove the authenticated user from the dabase.

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "deleteUser": {
>       "id": "cjxniy19a001d07615bz4u8zj",
>       "name": "gg1",
>       "email": "yg@email.com"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```





As far as the `deletePost()` mutation, we'll want to not only ensure that the user is authenticated, but we also want to make sure that they own the post that we are deleting. To achieve this we're going to use the `.exists()` method to make sure that the post exists and that the author id from the post matches the `userId`

```js
  async deletePost(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
    const userId = getUserId(request);// verifies auth token returns userId
    if (!userId) throw new Error('please login');

    const postExists = await prisma.exists.Post({
      // find the match post based on the following criteria:
      id: args.id,
      author: {
        id: userId
      }
    })

    if (!postExists) throw new Error('unable to delete post');

    return await prisma.mutation.deletePost({ where: { id: args.id } }, info)
    // passes in verified userId to deletePost
  },
```

"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyaWQiOiJjanhvMWptMTMwMDBzMDc2MXc3NGxxZjRzIiwiaWF0IjoxNTYyNTQ2NzY1fQ.BaCIBUWKlQ2Q3N3uotLC4ftcK1jBjZl5tWup2n5kvA0"

Now we'll ensure that we have two users in the database, and  we'll try to delete one user's posts, from another user's id to ensure that only the owner of the post is actually able to remove the post - we should see our "unable to delete post" error message:

```js
mutation deletePost{
  deletePost(id: "cjxto0rhu00240761j3dszrrj") {
    id
    comments{
      id
    }
  }
}

```
