# Generate JSON Web Token

---------------------------------

Now that we have our hashed password, successfully saving from our `createUser` mutation to our database, we can deal with generating a JSON web token from the response. This token is stored on the client-side and passes along with all future requests, whenever authentication is required. (i.e., creating a post, updating user info, etc.). Each token is associated with a specific user, and can be set to expire after a certain amount of time, or by other parameters.

`src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

```js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'
```



We'll explore a few methods available to us from `jwt`:

```js
jwt.sign({id: userId}, 'mysecret')
```

> - `{payload}` -  1st arg, contains data we want to pass along, we're using the id
>
> - `secret` - 2nd arg, used to verify the integrity of the token, ensuring it wasn't tampered with. 
>
>   > it is best practice to break the jwt secret out into an envrionment variable (`.env`)
>
>  `jwt.sign()` returns the token, so its best practice to save it to a variable:
>
> ```js
> const token = jwt.sign({id: userId}, 'mysecret')
> console.log(token)
> ```
>
> Which logs our token to the console:

> ```



**NOTE**: the `{payload}` that gets passed in as the first argument to `jwt.sign({payload}, secret)`, is open to the public, that is why we have the secret attached with it. Requiring someone to have access to both, in order authenticate. And while the payload is publicly facing, our secret is not. It is only available to the node server. 

To visualize this we can use the `.decode()` from `jwt` to decode the token, and see what get's logged to the console:

```js
const decoded = jwt.decode(token);
console.log(decoded)
```

> This is what gets returned:
>
> ```js
> { id: 12, iat: 1562135511 }
> ```
>
> **NOTE**: that the id, is given right back to us, but the `secret` is not. We also have the `iat` property which stands for `issued at`, and is used for setting and managing the token expiry. 

Next we can verify our token using the secret:

```js
jwt.verify(token, secret)
```

> This method will return true if the given token and secret can be verified, otherwise returns false. 

in our example:

```js

const decoded = jwt.decode(token);
console.log(decoded)

const verified = jwt.verify(token, 'mysecret');
console.log(verified);
```

> ```js
> { id: 12, iat: 1562135846 } // decoded
> { id: 12, iat: 1562135846 } // verified
> ```
>
> As we can see `verified ` logs the same data as `decoded`, but the difference is that only the data returned by verified can be used for authentication purposes. 
>

> What happens when someone tampers with our secret:

> ```js
> const verified = jwt.verify(token, 'blue');
> console.log(verified);

Now we can go ahead and use this in our code:

```js
    const user = await prisma.mutation.createUser({  // creates and returns new user
      data: {
        ...args.data, // spread out data that gets passed in
        password, // override the password, that user passed in, with the hashed version.
      }
    }, info);

    return {
      user,
      token: jwt.sign({ userid: user.id }, 'thisisasecret')
    }
```



Currently our `createUser` mutation is just returning the newly created user, 

```js
    createUser(data: CreateUserInput!): User!
```

instead we'll want to retun a new object with both the token and the user on it. To handle this we'll need to add a new `TypeDef` in `schema.graphql`:

```js
type AuthPayload {
    token: String!
    user: User!
}
```



Now we can return the `AuthPayload` rather than only the new `User`:

```js
createUser(data: CreateUserInput!): AuthPayload!
```

> Currently even this will throw an error, when we run it:
>
> ```js
> mutation createUser{
>   createUser(data:{name: "jess", email: "jess@gmail.com", password:"abc12345"}){
>    user {
>    id
>     name
>     email
>   }
>     token
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> ```js
>   "errors": [
>     {
>       "message": "Field 'createUser' of type 'User' must have a sub selection. (line 2, column 3):\n  createUser(data: $_v0_data)\n  ^",
>       "locations": [],
>       "path": [
>         "createUser"
>       ]
> ```
>
> The error wants us to have a subselection, this is directly related to the `info` argument we pass into our mutations, in this case we'll be leaving off the 2nd argument for our purposes.



Now we can simply run our query again: 

```js
mutation createUser{
  createUser(data:{name: "jess", email: "jess@ymail.com", password:"abc12345"}){
   user {
   id
    name
    email
  }
    token
  }
}
```

>   "data": {
>     "createUser": {
>       "user": {
>         "id": "cjxmw3ymp00bd0761oevae1fk",
>         "name": "jess",
