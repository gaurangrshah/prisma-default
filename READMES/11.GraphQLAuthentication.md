# Authentication with GraphQL

---------------------------------

We currently have a working graphQL database, that we can query and write mutations for, the problem is that so can everyone else. Authentication with GraphQL means, that users will have to authenticate to retreive data and/or post data and especially when creating and deleting data. This means we'll need to put some measures in place that not only check to see if a user is authenticated, but also to verify they are allowed to make the changes to the database that they are looking to make. Sometimes that means to check if a user is the the user who created or owns the item. In other cases, we may just want to verify that a user has a certain level of clearance before they're able to make a certain request. This is how we can control what information is available and who can access it. 



In a more real world example, for our blog, you will have some published posts, these posts should require authentication to view, although our draft posts, and private posts would require verification that you are the user that created those posts. 

To do this we use Node.js as our middleman btw the user and our prisma graphQL db. 



Modify the prisma import statement in: `src/index.js`: 

```js
import { prisma } from './prisma'
// importing here to add to application context
```

> **NOTE**: you'll want to make sure that prisma is being export properly from: `src/prisma.js`:
>
> ```js
> import { Prisma } from 'prisma-binding';
> // "Prisma" - is a constructor function used to create a connection to a prisma endpoint
> 
> // call prisma constructor and store its return value:
> const prisma = new Prisma({
>   typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
>   endpoint: 'http://192.168.99.100:4466'
> });
> 
> export { prisma as default }
> ```



By importing `prisma` into our `index.js` file we can no ensure its available to our entire application via `context`:

```js
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: './src/schema.graphql',
  resolvers,
  context: {
    db,
    pubsub,
    
    prisma // makes prisma available to application context.
  }
});
```

> adding prisma to context - allowing us to access all of our prisma bindings? 

The Current State of the Query.js file: `src/resolvers/Query.js`:

```js
const Query = {
  users(parent, args, { db }, info) {
    if (!args.query) return db.users;
    
    return db.users.filter((user) => {
      return user.name.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase());
    })
  },
  posts(parent, args, { db }, info) {
    if (!args.query) return db.posts;
    return db.posts.filter((post) => {
      const titleMatch = post.title.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase());
      const bodyMatch = post.body.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase());
      return titleMatch || bodyMatch
    })
  },
  post() {
    return {
      id: "001",
      title: "First Post Test Title",
      body: "Some Lorem Ipsum for the post body",
      published: false
    }
  },
  comments(parent, args, { db }, info) {
    return db.comments;
  },
  me() {
    return {
      id: "123098",
      name: "Mike",
      email: "mike@example.com"
    }
  },
}

export { Query as default };
```



Our goal now is to modify our Query file to grab our data from the prisma database instead of our local db - as we can see below we've now destructured `prisma` from `context` rather than `db`:

```js
const Query = {
	users(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {
    // destructuring prisma from context
    return prisma.query.users(null, info)
    // passing in info from `args` to users query as 2nd arg.
  });
}
```

> we've passed in an {object} as the 2nd `arg` in our `users` query, it's not an object that we define, its actually defined for us and available to us from the ==`info`== `arg` on each of our queries and mutations.
>
> ```js
> users(parent, args, { prisma }, info) { });
> ```
>
> > info contains all of the information from the "?original operation?". This operation would exist in a web browser or an iOS app, (i.e., "the client"), and is then sent to the server and then is accessible in our queries and mutations via the ==`info`== arg.
>
> This will allow us to retain more flexibility in what we can query for. 
>
> **NOTE**: ==we've also destructured `prisma` from context to access the query from it.==



> Before we get too far into this we need to make a slight change to `src/schema.graphql`:
>
> ```js
> type User {
>     id: ID!
>     name: String!
>     email: String!
>     // age: Int // => deleted
>     posts: [Post!]!
>     comments: [Comment!]!
> }
> ```
>
> > remove the age field as we will not be needing it any longer.

---------------------------------

Modify Posts Query to return posts from the database: `src/resolvers/Query.js`

```js
  posts(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {
    return prisma.query.posts(null, info);
    // if (!args.query) return db.posts;
    // return db.posts.filter((post) => {
    //   const titleMatch = post.title.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase());
    //   const bodyMatch = post.body.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase());
    //   return titleMatch || bodyMatch
    // })
  },
```

> To test if this works we need to run the respective query in `GQL`:
>
> ```js
> query posts {
>   posts {
>     id
>     title
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "data": {
> >     "posts": [
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxj9ts6u002j0761e56cm260",
> >         "title": "prisma post"
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxjts0cw008o07617m119drm",
> >         "title": "new post title"
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxjux83k009r07617y4r3flr",
> >         "title": "updated title"

> >         "id": "cjxjzjpin00ah0761knprxwwm",
