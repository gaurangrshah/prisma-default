# Locking Down Queries

---------------------------------

We'll want to use the same logic as we did for locking down  mutations, in order to help lock down our queries. It is a bit harder to lock down queries than it is to lock down mutations, so we'll also account for that aspect as well. The thing that makes our queries harder to lock down is that some queries will be accessible to both logged in and logged out users, the difference being that logged in users are prevy to a bunch of information and details about a post that a logged out user cannot access, things like private posts, and drafts are a few such examples, where only a logged in user, who owns the particular posts should be able to see them or even list them. This allows us to serve up public posts to any user who vists, while all private, draft, and other secured posts are only accessible by logged in users who own the specific post. 

> We also have `comments` query 

So in short to summarize, we'll be locking down the private parts of queries and leaving open any public facing queries



We'll start looking at locking down queries using post query: `schema.graphql`:

```js
post(id: ID!): Post!
```

> here we've updated the post query to take in an argument: `id`, which is required(`!`) as `non-nullable`



We'll need to modify our `getUserId()` func to handle the `id` we want to pass in with our `queries`: `src/utils/getUserId.js`:

```js
const getUserId = (request, requireAuth = true) => {
  //added, argument for "requireAuth" which is defaulted to "true"

 /* .. */
  
}
```

> so now by default anytime we want to check for the userId from mutations or queries, we can pass in a false argument for requireAuth for any public mutations/queries, while passing in true, or not passing in a value will default it to true, which will reuire authorization in order to perform that particular mutation or query. 
>
> Passing in the default value, allows us to keep all the mutations as is, and won't require us to make an changes to handle the requireAuth argument for them, passing no argument, will default to true as the fallback.



Now we can pass in `false` form our query for the requrieAuth argument, allowing it to bypass the authorization requirement: `src/resolvers/Query.js`

```js
const userId = getUserId(request, false)
```

> if user is not authenticated, no error will be thrown - userId will just be set to undefined when the function runs.



We'll need to re-structure our functions structure, to better suit our new logic `src/utils/getUserId.js`:

```js
const getUserId = (request, requireAuth = true) => {
  // grab header from request -> clear token -> verify token

  const header = request.request.headers.authorization
  // grab header from request


  if (header) {
    // run the following only when header exists

    const token = header.replace('Bearer ', '');
    // removes the word 'Bearer'  from header and replaces it with: '' (empty string)
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'thisisasecret')
    // verify the token using the secret we've used originally
    return decoded.userid;
  }

  if (requireAuth) {
    // if authorization is required and header does not exist throw error:
    throw new Error('authentication required')
  }

}
```

> in the new structure, we'll throw an error only when authorization is required and a header does not exist.



So with this logic in place we can now we can modify the `post` query to allow it to take in the `id` argument, and telling it what to do with it, when the id argument is passed in â€” currently our post query looks like this:

```js
  post(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) {
    const userId = getUserId(request, false)
    // 2nd argument "false" sets authRequired to = false. Making this a public query.
    
    return {
      id: "001",
      title: "First Post Test Title",
      body: "Some Lorem Ipsum for the post body",
      published: false
    }
  },
```

> we are just returning some dummy data when someone queried for a post. , instead we'll want to actually return the specific post from the database, that matches the id passed in as an argumnet:
>
> ```js
> const posts = await prisma.query.posts({}, info)
> ```
>
> > **NOTE**: we can query for a singluar `post` with prisma, but the number of arguments we can provide are limited for singular queries to just `id's` that are unique. Instead if we use the ==`posts` query we'll have alot more extensibility available to us==. That is going to be how we approach querying for a `post`
> >
> > **NOTE**: we've used `await` for our query so we'll need to ensure that our `post` query has `async` assigned to it:
>
> ```js
>   async post(parent, args, { prisma, request }, info) { /* .. */ }
> ```



Now we can handle how we want to search for (or filter through) our posts:

```js
    const posts = await prisma.query.posts({
      where: {
        id: args.id,
      }
    }, info)
```

> using the id passed in via arguments, to filter out the matching post



Then we need to check if this post, is viewable by the user requesting it:

```js
    const posts = await prisma.query.posts({
      where: {
        id: args.id, // find matching post
        OR: [{ // can match post using any of the following criteria:
          published: true // matches if post is published & availble to the public.
        }, {
          author: {
            id: userId // matches if this user is the author of this post
          }
        }]
        // check if the post is published or if this user is the author of this post
      }
    }, info)
```

> the operate `OR` takes one argument which is an array of objects, that can be used to match content, in this case, we check if the post is published with the first object in the array or if the user requesting the post is the author of the post. In either case, the post would match, and the user would be able to view the content, but if either case doesn't match and the 

Now we have one final issue in our `getUserId()` and that is when an user is not authenticated this `userId` is set to `undefined`, and that presents a problem, because that means this author query is going to be looking for `undefined`. This means that it's always going to consider something a match if it's not actually limited by anything. And that is the actual problem, so to fix that , we can use a quick tweak to get user ID, by returning `null`: `src/utils/getUserId.js`:

```js
const getUserId = (request, requireAuth = true) => {
  
  /*...*/ 

  return null
}
```

> returning `null` will allow us to keep our query in tact by not setting our `userId` to `undefined` as is the case with the default functionality.



Next we can focus on handling what happens if no post was found or sending the correct data back when a matching post is found: `src/resolvers/Query.js`

```js

    const userId = getUserId(request, false)
   
    const posts = await prisma.query.posts({
		// expecting an array of posts, since we're querying for 'posts'
      
      /* ... */

    }, info)

    // handle response:
    if(posts.length === 0) throw new Error('post not found');
		// throw error if no matching posts found.

    return posts[0]
// return the first matching post, (will be the only post in the array if there is an actual match)

  },
```

> This will ensure that unless a post is published, which means its available to everyone, the user must own the post, themselves in order to access that specific post



We'll need to make sure we're importing the `getUserId()` func into `Query.js`:

```js
import getUserId from '../utils/getUserId';
```



Test the query:

```js
query {
  post(id: "cjxtpad36000e0761i1h85uqj") {
    id
    title
    published
    author{
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "post": {
>       "id": "cjxtpad36000e0761i1h85uqj",
>       "title": "Master Post 1",
>       "published": true,
>       "author": {
>         "id": "cjxmu83iz00ay0761rmamyoeu",
>         "email": "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```



Now if we were to run the same query for a post we don't actually own:

```js
query {
  post(id: "cjxtpad36000e0761i1h85uqj") {
    id
    title
    published
    author{
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

>```json
>{
>  "data": null,
>  "errors": [
>    {
>      "message": "post not found",
>      "locations": [
>        {
>          "line": 2,
>          "column": 3
>        }
>      ],
>      "path": [
>        "post"
>      ]
>    }
>  ]
>}
>```



We also have access to unpublished posts that belong to us:

```js
query {
  post(id: "cjxtphvaj001d076198p4lvbo") {
    id
    title
    published
    author{
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "post": {
>       "id": "cjxtphvaj001d076198p4lvbo",
>       "title": "Updated This Post",
>       "published": false,
>       "author": {
>         "id": "cjxtnxcdg001t076161tk4kcl",
>         "email": "g@g.com"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```



But not unpublished posts from different users, as none of their posts unless public can be queried for or viewed.



Challenge: Lock down `me` query:
