# Lock Down Individual Type Fields

---------------------------------

Currently we've added some required authentication when retrieving another users posts, we've only allowed published posts to get returned from our posts query, but currently this does not stop us from querying for users, then listing out the posts that belong to that user. And when we do we actually get back all of that users posts, not just the published ones, and this is a problem:

```js
query users {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      id
      title
      published
      comments {
        text
        author {
          id
          name
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As we see in the example query above just by querying for users we're able to bypass all of our authentication logic when it comes to public and private posts. This is exactly what we'll want to avoid, along with not exposing certain fields at all, like a user's email address. We'll lock down some fields so that you can't query for them at all. 

So our problem is not related to our user query itself but rather a problem of our selection sets.

> **NOTE**: if we want to hide a certain field permanently from all queries, all we'd have to do is to remove the field from the type defs for `User`, this would remove email from being available to any query, but this is not the approach we want for our application, we need the user's email to do things like handle authentication, and our `me` query.  In our case we need to more well rounded approach:
>
> 
>
> Step 1: Make the email field `nullable`: `src/schema.graphql`:
>
> ```js
> type User {
>     id: ID!
>     name: String!
>     #email: String!
>     email: String
>     password: String!
>     posts: [Post!]!
>     comments: [Comment!]!
> }
> ```
>
> > this allows us to return null when for queries when we don't want the email to be output, while still returning the email when we need to. 
>
> 
>
> Step 2: Define a custom resolver to handle the email field: `src/resolvers/User.js`:
>
> ```js
> const User = {
> 	email(parent, args, ctx, info) {
>     
>   }
> }
> 
> export { User as default };
> ```
>
> Now we can handle the logic where we dictate when to return either an email as a `String` or to return `null`. this resolver can now dictates when the email field actually gets returned.
>
> 
>
> Step 3: Utilize the user object available from the `parent` arg, to check if the current authenticated user matches `parent.id` to do this we'll need access to `getUserId()`:
>
> ```js
> import getUserId from '../utils/getUserId.js'
> ```
>
> ```js
> 	email(parent, args, ctx, info) {
>     const userId = getUserId(request, false);
>     // authentication is not required. (!userId) => userId = null
>   }
> ```
>
> 
>
> Step 4: Setup conditional logic to determine if current logged in user's `id` matches `parent.id`:
>
> ```js
>     if (userId && userId == parent.id) {
>       // if userId exists and is equal to 'parent.id then => parent.email
>       return parent.email
>     } else { // otherwise => null
>       return null
>     }
> ```
>
> Step 5: Test Work:
>
> ```js
> query users {
>   users {
>     id
>     name
>     email
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > We can only return an email of the user who is querying, all other user's emails in any query will now abide by this logic.  
> >
> > ```js
> > {
> >   "data": {
> >     "users": [
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxmu83iz00ay0761rmamyoeu",
> >         "name": "greg",
> >         "email": null
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxo1jm13000s0761w74lqf4s",
> >         "name": "gg1",
> >         "email": "yg@email.com"
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "id": "cjxtnxcdg001t076161tk4kcl",
> >         "name": "g",
> >         "email": null
> >       }
> >     ]
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
>
> Now our current code, works well in most cases, but there is an edge case where we will have issues - in this hypothetical situation, we are only going to query for a user's email:
>
> ```js
> query users {
>   users {
>     email
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > which returns: 
> >
> > ```js
> > {
> >   "data": {
> >     "users": [
> >       {
> >         "email": null
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "email": null
> >       },
> >       {
> >         "email": null
> >       }
> >     ]
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
>
> This query returns null for each field, because we've removed the id and email from the query, which are required to identify the email or id belonging to the right user, because our logic in `User.js` is dependent upon the `id` value being available from `parent`



To solve for this edge case, we'll need to utilize `GraphQL Fragments`
