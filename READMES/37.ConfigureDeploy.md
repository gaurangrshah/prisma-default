# Configure & Deploy with Prisma 

---------------------------------

In order to setup our production server we'll need to deploy our datamodel to that server, in order to do that we'll need to make some adjustments to our application:

`prisma/prisma.yml`: (current):

```js
endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
secret: thisismysupersecrettext 
```

> prisma refers to this file when deploying,  - currently we're deploying to our local docker instance based on our currently configured endpoint. 



### setup dynamic production endpoint:

We'll use `env` variables to help us dictate which endpoint we want prisma to deploy to when deploying, to set that up we'll create two `.env` files, one for our the values needed to deploy to `heroku-prod` and the other to deploy to our local docker container. 

> create: `prisma/config/`
>
> - `dev.env`
> - `prod.env`





Let's make sure our dev environment gets setup properly before we setup the new production database: `prisma/config/dev.env`:

```js
PRISMA_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.99.100:4466
```



Now we can let prisma know to use our newly defined `.env` value for our endpoint:

`prisma/prisma.yml`

```js
endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}

datamodel: datamodel.graphql
secret: thisismysupersecrettext
```



Before we redploy our database, we need to redeploy our local container:

```shell
graph-new/prisma on  master [!?] 

➜ docker-compose up -d
```



Now instead of running `prisma deploy` we can instead specify the variables we want the command to use:

```shell
graph-new/prisma on  master [!?] 

➜  prisma deploy -e ../config/dev.env
```

> file path is relative to the `prisma/` since the command is run from that directory.

Since we've already deployed to our container we should just see a message that says "Service is already up to date":

```shell
Deploying service `default` to stage `default` to server `default` 1.2s
Service is already up to date.
```



Now we can take a look at how to deploy to our production database on heroku in the same way - to start we'll need to login to prisma via the commandline:

```shell
graph-new/prisma on  master [⇡$!] 
➜ prisma login    

Authenticating ✔
Authenticated with gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com
Successfully signed in
```

```shell
prisma deploy -e ../config/prod.env
```

**NOTE** : currently we do not have any variable setup for `prod.env` instead when we run this command prisma will see it has a new database that we're trying to deploy because when it tryes to look for an endpoint it will find nothing there instead. 

This will allow us to select and setup our database via the commandline interface:

```shell
graph-new/prisma on  master [⇡$!] took 2s 
➜ prisma deploy -e ../config/prod.env

 ▸    [WARNING] in /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-new/prisma/prisma.yml: A valid
 ▸    environment variable to satisfy the declaration 'env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT' could not be found.

? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server? (Use arrow keys)
                         
                         
  Or deploy to an existing Prisma server:
❯ graph-prisma-dev/dev-prime        Production Prisma cluster 
  Demo server + MySQL database      Free development environment hosted in Prisma Cloud 
  Use other server                  Manually provide endpoint of a running Prisma server 
  ? Choose a name for your service prisma-graph-node-blog
	? Choose a name for your stage prod
	

	Written endpoint `https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod` to 	prisma.yml

```

Once we've setup the server correctly prisma will write our new production endpoint to our `prisma/prisma.yml`:

```js
#endpoint: ${env:PRISMA_ENDPOINT}
endpoint: https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod
datamodel: datamodel.graphql
secret: thisismysupersecrettext # Can be
```

> it actually commented out or original endpoint and added the new endpoint for us.



Now when we run:

```js

```



`prisma/datamodel.graphql`:

```js
type User {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  name: String!
  email: String! @unique
  password: String!
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostToUser", onDelete: CASCADE)
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentToUser", onDelete: CASCADE)
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  title: String!
  body: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User! @relation(name: "PostToUser", onDelete: SET_NULL)
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentToPost", onDelete: CASCADE)
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
}

type Comment {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  text: String!
  author: User! @relation(name: "CommentToUser", onDelete: SET_NULL)
  post: Post!@relation(name: "CommentToPost", onDelete: SET_NULL)
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  updatedAt: DateTime! @updatedAt
}
```

That successfully updates our server for us and we can verify that:
