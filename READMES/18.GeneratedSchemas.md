# Allowing For Generated Schemas

---------------------------------

Non-authenticated users will only be able to do one thing, "read published posts". Everything else will require authentication..

In order to set this up we'll need to start by adding a new field to our `User` type in `datamodel.prisma`:

```js
type User {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  name: String!
  email: String! @unique
  password: String!
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostToUser", onDelete: CASCADE)
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentToUser", onDelete: CASCADE)
}
```

> we've added the `password` field and except it to be a `non-nullable` `String`

We'll need to make this same change to our `schema.graphql`:

```js
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    password: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
    comments: [Comment!]!
}
```



Next up we'll want to clear out our database for this new change to occur, since User's are our most basic unit of data, we cannot make this change to the user type while we have any users already in the database. We could just remove our users manually, but that would just delete all their associated data anyway, so it is just best to clear out the whole database, and start from scracth here.

Run the following command from the `prisma/` directory:

```shell
prisma delete && prisma deploy
```

Since we've just updated the datamodel.graphql file, we'll need to graph a new updated schema from the prisma database, we'll need to run the following command from the project root: `graphql-prisma/`

```js
npm run get-schema
```

> Currently when we run this command it fails, that is because we are locked out from using this command because of the secret we setup.
>
> Our work around for this is to update our `.graphqlconfig` file with the necc. priivileges to access the endpoint @:4466, 
>
> ```js
> {
>   "projects": {
>     "prisma": {
>       "schemaPath": "src/generated/prisma.graphql",
>       "extensions": {
>         "prisma": "prisma/prisma.yml",
>         "endpoints": {
>           "default": "http://192.168.99.100:4466'"
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> > we've added the `prisma` property to our `"extensions"` object, providing two routes to access the database. All of our client side requests will still use the default endpoint we've defined, while our `get-schema` command will be able to fallback to the `prisma.yml` settings to access the database.
>
> **NOTE**: this method only works because we have our `prisma/`  directory available to us in our project structure this allows us to get the schema without actually having to hit the endpoint@:4466
>
> And now we can re-run our the command:
>
> ```shell
> npm run get-schema
> ```
>
> > ```shell
> > âžœ npm run get-schema
> > 
> > > graph-basics@1.0.0 get-schema /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-prisma
> > > graphql get-schema -p prisma
> > 
> > project prisma - Schema file was updated: src/generated/prisma.graphql
> > ```



> We stilll have one more step that we need to complete and that will be ensure that we're handling the password that we want the user to provide in our `createUser` mutation in `src/resolvers/mutation.js`
