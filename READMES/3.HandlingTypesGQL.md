## Editing Types

---------------------------------

Next let's see how we can go about making some changes to the `User` type:

```js
type User {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  name: String!
  email: String! @unique
}
```

> we've added the email field to our `User` type definition, we've specified that emails are expected to be a non-nullable string, which is to say that they are required as denoted by: (`"!"`), 
>
> **NOTE**: we've also added the `@unique` "`directive`", a directive is way to modify the behavior of the field. Directives are typically something that we would specifically need to create in order to ensure our data functions the way we need it to. 
>
> However, `@unique` is in fact a directive that prisma has exposed to us. 
>
> **ALSO NOTE**: directives can also take arguments, 
>
> ```json
> @directive(args)
> ```
>
> ==but `@unique` does not take any arguments.==
>
> Any fields with the `@unique` directive must not match of the value of any other tiem in the same field. So two different users cannot have the same id or the same email. Both of those fields needs to be unique for each of our users.

Anytime we make a change to our datamodel, we must be sure to deploy our schema again:

```shell
prisma deploy
```

> this will sync our updated datamodel with prisma, and prisma will then generate the schema that allows us to perform the queries and mutations that we need on this data.

In our case, we already have existing users, so this will result in an error, because we are creating a field on our `User` type that we have made `required`, which is fine, except that we already have a user in our database, and that user wasn't required to provide an email. This is what triggers this error, it is that we already have a user in our database, that does not meet the criteria of this updated type definition. We either need to:

- Add an email to the user that exists in the database
- or delete the user and force each user for this point forward to provide an email

> In our case deleting the user makes perfect sense, so that will allow us to re-deployed after we've emptied out the database of all users. We can delete the data from `PGAdmin` or by using the `deleteUser` Mutation.

```shell
prisma deploy
```

Note that since we've required our users to have `@unique` emails and ids, we cannot create another user with the same email:

```js
mutation createUser{
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Vik"
    email: "vik@email.com"
  }){
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

```js
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "createUser"
      ],
      "code": 3010,
      "message": "A unique constraint would be violated on User. Details: Field name = email",
      "requestId": "local:cjxj8vri3001f07610ckmh67a"
    }
  ]
}
```

The error above tells us that emails must be unique.



## Add New Type

------

Adding a new type starts by defining the type in our `datamodel.prisma` - in this case we'll 

```js
type Post {
  id: ID! @id @unique
  title: String!
  body: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User! # references the User type
}
```

> published is a non-nullable `Boolean` - must be either true or false
>
> author - is a field that gets associated with the `User` who creates the post, so author will always return a `User!`
>
> This relationship must go both ways:
>
> ```js
> type User {
> id: ID! @id @unique
> name: String!
> email: String! @unique
> posts: [Post!]!
> }
> ```
>
> we've made sure that the `User` type also knows that it can have posts associated with it, in this case, it is an array of `Post!` items.

Then we can re-deploy our schema:

```js
prisma deploy
```

> which will result in a bunch of changes to the database:
>
> ```js
> Changes:
> 
> Post (Type)
>   + Created type `Post`
>   + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
>   + Created field `title` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `body` of type `String!`
>   + Created field `published` of type `Boolean!`
>   + Created field `author` of type `User!`
> 
> User (Type)
>   + Created field `posts` of type `[Post!]!`
> 
> PostToUser (Relation)
>   + Created an inline relation between `Post` and `User` in the column `author` of table `Post`
> ```



Let's test this out by creating a new post for our user:

```js
mutation createPost {
  createPost(data: {
  	title: "prisma post"
    body: ""
    published: true
    author: {
      connect: {
        id: "cjybuipuw00170818deitqfbr"
      }
    }
  }){
    id
    title
    published
    author{
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

> We simply need an unique identifier for that user (`name` or  `email`) in order to create a post associated with them, prisma provides a utitlity to do just that called `connect: UserWhereUniqueInput`, and what connect does is to connect (or associate) one piece of data with another. In our cases we want to connect our post to a user.

>         "name": "vik"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> As we can see we've not connected a new post to our existing user.
>
> **NOTE**: keep in mind that we can also create a new user to associate with our post when creating a post instead of connecting it to an existing user.





- Add `Comments` type Definition: `datamodel.prisma`:

  ```js
  type Comment {
      id: ID!
      text: String!
      author: User!
      post: Post!
  }
  ```

- re-deploy to prisma

  ```js
  Changes:
  
    Comment (Type)
    + Created type `Comment`
    + Created field `id` of type `ID!`
    + Created field `text` of type `String!`
    + Created field `author` of type `User!`
    + Created field `post` of type `Post!`
  
    CommentToUser (Relation)
    + Created an inline relation between `Comment` and `User` in the column `author` of table `Comment`
  
    CommentToPost (Relation)
    + Created an inline relation between `Comment` and `Post` in the column `post` of table `Comment`
