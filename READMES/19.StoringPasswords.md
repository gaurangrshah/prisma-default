# Storing Passwords

---------------------------------

We're going to start by modifying our `createUser` mutation, we're going to be setting it up to take a password in and then we can perform a few opertions on the password:

```
take in pw  ->  validate pw  ->  hash pw  ->  generate auth token
```

> We will be able to generate and send back an auth token with the `signup` and `login` "operations"

We need to make sure that our `CreateUserInput` definition knows to expect a password-- `schema.graphql`:

```js
input CreateUserInput {
    name: String!
    email: String!
    password: String!
}
```

> new field: `password` must be a `non-nullable String`

Now that we're accepting a password in our schema, we can now validate the password that gets passed in from the `createUser` mutation`src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

```js
if(args.data.password.length < 8) {
  throw new Error('Password must be 8 characters or longer')
}
```

> The validation makes sure that the password provided is atleast 8 characters in length. 

Next we'll want to hash our password before we store it in our database, there are many different ways to hash passwords, and we know we can't just save it as a string for security reasons, so we'll be using the `bcrypt` library. 

https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js

We'll need to install bcrypt:

```shell
npm i bcryptjs@2.4.3
```

And we can uninstall `uuid`, as we are no longer using it:

```shell
npm uninstall uuid
```



We'll need to import `bcrypt` into `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`:

```js
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'
```



We can use the `hash()` from `bcrypt` that allows us to pass in a string and generate a `hash`, which is a seemingly random series of characters. This hashed version of the password is then stored in the database. Then when a user logs in or is authenticated, we use our hash to validate their password again.

> **NOTE**: hasing algorithms work one-way, meaning we can take a string and hash it, but you cannot take a hash, and 'unhash' it or decrypt it.

The `hash()` method expects two arguments:

- `string` - a string that is the password which will be hashed.
- `length` - the length we want to generate in our hashed(`salt`) 
  		-  a salt is a random series of characters that are hashed along with the string you're hashing. this means that the same string will never generate the same hash, our salt will get added essentially obscuring it further with a random series of numbers.

```js
async createUser(parent, args, { prisma }, info) {

  if (args.data.password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password must be 8 characters or longer')
  }

  const password = await bcrypt.hash(args.data.password, 10)
  // hash will take in password and generate a hash with a length of 10 added onto the hashed password.

  return prisma.mutation.createUser({  // creates and returns new user
    data: {
      ...args.data, // spread out data that gets passed in, which includes user's password
      password, // override the password, that user passed in, with the hashed version.
    }
  }, info);

},
```



Now we can test this `@:4001`:

We'll need to update the mutation, so that we're passing in a password and returning the hash:

```js
mutation createUser{
  createUser(data:{name: "greg", email: "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com", password:"password"}){
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

> ```json
> {
>   "data": {
>     "createUser": {
>       "id": "cjxmu83iz00ay0761rmamyoeu",
>       "name": "greg",
>       "email": "gaurang.r.shah@gmail.com"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> We can also double-check that we've saved the hashed password to the database:

>
> We can now see that we have a hashed password saved in the database for our new user.



The next step is to generate an auth token from a successful response.
