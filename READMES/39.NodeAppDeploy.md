# Node Production App Deployment

---------------------------------

We'll be using Heroku to deploy our Node js apps from the commandline. We'll be integrating git as our version control system and to track our code changes. This will also allow us to setup a pipeline that will deploy from git straight to heroku for us. 

> - pre-requisite: must have git installed:
>
>   ```js
>   git version
>   ```
>
>   

The next tool we'll be using is the `Heroku CLI`: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli This allows us to deploy and manage our Heroku apps from the commandline with some very usefule commands.

> ```js
> npm install -g heroku
> ```
>
> Login to `Heroku`:
>
> ```shell
> heroku login
> ```
>
> > ```json

We'll need to configure our server to work with the heroku cli `src/index.js`:

```js
server.start(() => {
    console.log('The server is up!')
})
```

> Currently when we run our node app locally, we get assigned a port for Heroku automatically which defaults to `port:4000`, but our Heroku app, gets its port assigned by it's endpoint that Heroku generates for us. This is where we'll need to modify our server to take in an options object using the start method available to us from `graphql-yoga`:

>
> The `start()` can take several arguments as options, we're going to be using it to set the `port` property:

>
> ```js
> server.start({ port: process.env.PORT }, () => {
>     console.log('The server is up!')
> })
> ```
>
> 
>
> This setup will work fine for our production server, but It will not work when we run our local development server, for now we can provide the local port `4000` as a fallback for the port propery on our `start()`:
>
> ```js
> server.start({ port: process.env.PORT || 4000 }, () => {
>     // using the conditional operator to provide a fallback port for local dev.env and allow heroku to set the port programmatically.
>     console.log('The server is up!')
> })
> 
> ```
>
> 
>
> Next we'll need to update where we use it to connect to our production endpoint: `src/prisma.js`: (current):
>
> ```js
> 
> const prisma = new Prisma({
>     typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
>     endpoint: 'http://192.168.99.100:4466',
>     secret: 'thisismysupersecrettext',
>     fragmentReplacements
> })
> ```
>
> > we'll need to update the endpoint to utitlize the dynamic variables we setup in our `/config`
>
> ```js
>     endpoint: process.env.PRISMA_ENDPOINT,
> ```
>
> 



Before we setup the variables though, we'll need to ensure that our `start` script in `package.json`: current:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js --ext js,graphql --exec babel-node",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "get-schema": "graphql get-schema -p prisma"
  },
```

> heroku uses this file to build our application when we deploy. In order to do this it relies on our packages being define and our scripts that need to be executed also being defined. 
>
> Currently we're using `nodemon` in our development environment to reload our application when our files change for us. Although when we deploy to heroku - it cannot use nodemone as it is only a package meant for development purposes. Instead we'll need to provide Heroku with a script it can use to build our application each time it gets deployed.

To do this we'll take the contens of our current `start` script and rename it to `dev`:

```json
"dev": "nodemon src/index.js --ext js,graphql --exec babel-node",
```

>  We'll modify this script to ensure that our dev config file runs anytime we run our dev server - to do this we'll need to take advantage of another package library that helps us load & execute commands using a `.env` file.

Now we understand that Heroku will run our `start` script when we deploy our application to start up the application & we want to make sure that node also gets executed when our application starts up so we  can modify our `start` script to reflect our needs for production, by making sure `index.js` gets executed. We can also utitlize a series of scripts that Heroku supports to do things like run babel. Heroku supports several script that allow us to tap into the lifecycle of our application.

Now that the `heroku-postbuild` command is configured and doing most of our heavy lifting, now its up to Heroku, to use our `start` script, and all we want it to do is use node to serve up our `index.js` file:

```js
"start": "node dist/index.js"
```

Finally before we run this command let's make sure it loads our production configuration where we've defined our `heroku` endpoint as a `.env` variable using `env-cmd` again:

```js
"start": "env-cmd ./config/prod.env node dist/index.js"
```



Now if we were to run this script, it would fail:

```js
Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-new/dist/resolvers/Query.js:117
    var _ref7 = _asyncToGenerator( /*#__PURE__*/regeneratorRuntime.mark(function _callee(parent, args, _ref6, info) {
                                                ^

ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
```

> the reference error we encounter occurs due to the change in how we use babel differently in both environments. `babel-node` uses `regeneratorRuntime` already, where as `babel` itself does not. We'll need to use what;s known as a `polyfill` for babel that allows us to use the latest features of javascript, and let babel polyfill that for us to work in all environments.

### [babel/polyfill](babel/polyfill): https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill#docsNav

![image-20190725004937082](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79ly1g5bzo69co8j30ml0mcgpn.jpg)



To use the polyfill we'll need to install the package and import the functionalty into our app:

```js
npm i @babel/polyfill@7.0.0
```

`src/index.js`:

```js
import '@babel/polyfill'
```

> **NOTE**: should be place above anyother imports to allow full access to our application.

Now with all this setup we can  traðŸ¤Ÿ<u>`remove our entire`</u> `dist/` that we generated earlier and we'll go ahead and generate one for this purpose:

```js
npm run heroku-postbuild
```

> ```js
> > graphql-basics@1.0.0 heroku-postbuild /Users/bunty/Desktop/runjs/graph/graph-new
> > babel src --out-dir dist --copy-files

> src/utils/generateToken.js -> dist/utils/generateToken.js
> src/utils/getUserId.js -> dist/utils/getUserId.js
> src/utils/hashPassword.js -> dist/utils/hashPassword.js
> ```



```js
npm run start
```

> ```shell

> Now that we know the server is working, we can use this to setup our build process on `heroku`

The first step is to setup git in our project, so that we can commit our project and then initiate the build process directly from Heroku. 

> BEFORE: we commit to github, we'll want to make sure we're omitting two directories from our project:
>
> - `node_modules/` - contains all packages our project depends on, local and production have different dependencies so all production dependencies will only get installed in production while our local environment stays in tact. 
> - `config/` - it is a good practice **<u>NOT</u>** to commit any secrets, keys or other sensitive information, .git repositories are mainly public resources, and should be given an extra bit of scrutiny.

We can omit files from our repository, but explicitly omitting them in `.gitignore`:

```js
# ignore node/dependency directories
node_modules/
  
#ignore config files
config/
```

> Now since we're ignoring the `config/` this means that the `prod.env` file will not be available to our `start` script form package.json, we'll have to address this with Heroku, as the variable for the endpoint will be fed into Heroku directly, but we should remove that reference from our start script to avoid the app crashing:
>
> ```js
> "start": "node dist/index.js",
> ```
>
> > removes `env-cmd ./config/prod.env`

We'll also want to ignore our `dist/` since we'll be rebuilding this on our server with `heroku-postbuild` we'll be regenerating these files server-side, so we don't want to commit any of the files in the folder:

```js
#ignore local build folder
dist/
```





Before we push up this code, we'll want to prepare our Heroku application via the CLI:

```shell
graph-new on î‚  master [â‡•$] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v12.6.0 
âžœ heroku create 
```

> this will output our application information, url, repositiory, and web app name.
>
> ```shell
> Creating app... â£¾ 
> Creating app... done, â¬¢ whispering-citadel-73999
> https://whispering-citadel-73999.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/whispering-citadel-73999.git
> ```



Now that we have our app's vitals we can then setup our production endpoint environment variable with Heroku directly via the CLI:

```shell
heroku config:set PRISMA_ENDPOINT=https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod

```

> defines the production environment variable for our database with Heroku using `heroku config:set` which get's passed in any key/value pairs we need access to in production.

to do this we'll need to configure the environment variable for the endpoint refered to in `src/prisma.js`:(current):

```shell
graph-new on î‚  master [â‡•$!] is ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0 via â¬¢ v12.6.0 

âžœ heroku config:set PRISMA_ENDPOINT=https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod

Setting PRISMA_ENDPOINT and restarting â¬¢ whispering-citadel-73999... â£¾ 
Setting PRISMA_ENDPOINT and restarting â¬¢ whispering-citadel-73999... done, v3
PRISMA_ENDPOINT: https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod
[07/25/19 1:25] 
```



Then we can run the command again, this time, with no arguments:

```js
âžœ heroku config    

=== whispering-citadel-73999 Config Vars
PRISMA_ENDPOINT: https://dev-prime-9a2480a46c.herokuapp.com/prisma-graph-node-blog/prod
```

> this shows us the endpoint that we just gave to heroku.



Now we can setup our heroku remote using values we just setup`:

```shell
âžœ git remote -v                                                       
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/whispering-citadel-73999.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/whispering-citadel-73999.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:gaurangrshah/prisma-default.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:gaurangrshah/prisma-default.git (push)
[07/25/19 1:31] 
```

```js
git status && git add . && git commit "heroku pre-push"
```

```js
git push heroku master
```

> **NOTE**: heroku remote differs from our git remote - we can still push to the git remote and maintain both:
>
> ```js
> git push origin master
> ```
>
> > this pushes to the git repo as normal. 

The output from pushing to heroku is large and verbose as it completely builds our project creating the /dist folder each time, which is then accessible as per the output:

```js

   28a3cc3..9dd8cec  master -> master
```





Now we can use the url that we see to launch the graphql playground we now have on heroku - now we can run our queries and mutations here, â€” we have not deployed our local yet, so we'll only have one user in the database when running the `users` query

```js
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
